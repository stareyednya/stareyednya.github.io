# Dissertation Stage 3: Performance Analysis of Procedural Generation Techniques for Roguelike Game Levels

## Introduction 
For my Stage 3 Dissertation, I wanted to complete an algorithm-based project which would also allow me to become more familiar with using a commercial game engine. The final project combined this thought along with a personal interest in the Roguelike genre and random generation of continually different levels, leading to great enjoyment in the work. 

The project's aim was to implement two differing algorithms for procedurally generating a 'traditional' roguelike dungeon map within a game engine and compare their methods in terms of time taken, memory usage, and the playability of the result.

## Technologies Used
Unity game engine with C# programming. Unity's diagnostic profiler was also used for performance analysis.
