# Welcome!

You've reached the portfolio of Eleanor Gregory, currently a Game Engineering Masters student at Newcastle University and an aspiring game programmer with a love for hard work towards complete experiences, randomly generated content, and cats. 

Here you can view both game work I've completed for my degree and personal projects I've played with in my spare time. Being inspired onto a Game Engineering degree by past played games myself, I would love to help create similar experiences for others. I'm always excited to see what I can create through using my skills and new technologies, and love collaberating with others to develop even more indepth experiences.
